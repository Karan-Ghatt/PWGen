# PWGen #
        


## [Overview] ##
A pretty simple project; a simple password generator, with ability to record and recover passwords. A great project to get me a bit more familiar w/ Python and Tkinter.

I now want to create a web application of this project, using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS and. Ultimately, I want to be able to have CI/CD on this project, this is where GIT comes in.

I really want this project to be an example of a range of skills, with an insight into DevOpps.

## [First Update] [V1] ##
Functional webpage made w/ python and flask - simple flask form - user entry and password gen. 
Next step to recall password and then main Log-In.

## [Second Update] [V1'1] ##
Recall of password intergrated, along w/ landing page. 
Next step is to include a main log-in page.
