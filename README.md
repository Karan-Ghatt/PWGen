# PWGen
Python Password Generator made w/ Tkinter 
######################################################


A pretty simple project; a simple password generator, with ability to record and recover passwords. A great project to get me a bit more familiar w/ Python and Tkinter.

I now want to create a web application of this project, using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS and JS. Ultimately, I want to be able to have CI/CD on this project, this is where GIT comes in.

I really want this project to be an example of a range of skills, with an insight into DevOpps.
